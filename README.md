# pys60-mcs
Music Composition System for S60 Symbian

Written entirely on the mobile device,
this is a sysem for generating synthesized
melodies, by exporting them to wavefiles.

It has been tested to work on Nokia N70,
which it was written on.

Main features are

* piano roll editor
* additive synthesizer
* format specifier
* full RIFF parser/encoder
* complete GUI (vanilla PyS60 framework)

You shall need PyS60 installed on the device.
It is still available from Ensymbian project.

Alternatively, you could compile it into "sis",
and install it as an unsigned binary.

It is not a finished project, but I would
like to revive it in the near future.

The main script is called "mcs.py".

Feel free to use other modules as libraries
for your own projects, that is, if you're
interested in S60 development, or need
a way to create cool ringtones.
